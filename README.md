##Description
This is a simple jQuery slideshow that features a fade in and fade out animation, a caption for each image, and a previous and next button. Although the images are not the same size, they are the same width, which helps to standardize the view of the images.

##How to Run
In your browser, go to <a href="localhost:4040">localhost:4040</a>, and in your terminal, type "http-server -p 4040".
